# sei-project-4-he: 

# Brief
Create a full stack application using a Python Django REST Framework Backend to serve data from a Postgres Database and a React Frontend. Time period: 1 week. Pair project.

# Deployment
Please follow the link to the website: https://share-bnb.herokuapp.com/

# Motivation
As a pair we decided on a house swap website, where users would register their own property to search for another property to swap with. 

Our end product was Sharebnb, a clean, upmarket house swap website with social fucntionality and interconnectivity. All user data was created at random using external websites while property seed data was created by us.
